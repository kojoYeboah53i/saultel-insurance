 ##  fixing a stubborn bug

- first google the errors, pluck out key details out of the error message one at a time
- after you narrate the error to the problem title or specific technical term for the issue
- watch youtube videos, at least three on the subject 
- while watching makes notes on the code syntax with comments in a sanbox environments
- after that go to the official documentation for the programming language in question
- and start reading around the specific topics from the videos to dive deeper
- use the built examples from the documentation to try out your solution, sometimes u have refractor the whole function but that's ok
- then actually go back to the task board and code the solution into the application just as the task board requires it
- at your spare time document the solution and push it online for future use
