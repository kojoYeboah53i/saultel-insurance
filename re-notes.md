## back log
 - fix the sidebar to show active on the current page
 - align side nav to center

## ui ideas
 - three dashboards superadmin, partner and service provider
 - one side but the nav links changes depending on your role id
 - reports and analytics (search name like ajax live search)

pages controller
- [x] redirect with user-> role_id
- [x] sidebar menu items with role-id
- [ ] sidebar active on the current page
- [ ] cards showing claims, revenue and other with icons
- [ ] graph with bars showing partner distribution i.e claims and other
- [ ] transactions table ui
- [ ] page loader script to wait for doc ready
- [ ] route middleware for the role_id so that the routes to the pages will be protected by the role id
